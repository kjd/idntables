The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs
associated with the Danish language. The &#8216;#&#8217; symbol denotes start of a comment that
continues to the end of line.

Registrants are advised to carefully consider the potential confusion over the perception
of equivalence between an accented Latin character and a sequence of other Latin
characters (with or without accents.) There exists no equivalence rule that can be applied
universally as any such mappings are generally dependent on the language, culture and
context in which an IDN is used.</description>
