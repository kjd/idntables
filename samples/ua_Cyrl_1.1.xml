This document presents a character table used by Hostmaster Ltd for IDN
registrations in Cyrillic script.
It also applies to delegations for subdomains of .UA ccTLD where IDN
registrations are permitted.

The following characters are given in their Unicode code points in
format U+XXXX, where X is a hexadecimal digit.

I would like to express gratitude to NASK (.PL ccTLD registry) and
Andrzej Bartosiewicz for their IDN work,
which was instrumental in this implementation, as well as to
participants from local internet community.</description>
