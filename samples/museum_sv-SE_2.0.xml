&lt;p&gt;This document describes the Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Character
Table used by MuseDoma in the .MUSEUM TLD registry for the registration of .MUSEUM
domains in the Swedish language. The policies for the application of this table
are described in detail in the document referenced above and are in compliance
with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain
Names. The present document is intended for publication in the IANA IDN Character
Table Registry. It is provided exclusively for the information of prospective
holders of domains in .MUSEUM and for the users of resources within those domains.
It is not to be taken as a normative statement about the use of the Swedish
language in any other context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base characters are listed at the start of each line in this table by giving
their Unicode code points in U+xxxx format. If a base character is followed
by a vertical line &amp;quot;|&amp;quot;, all code points to the right of that line
are variants of the base character. If there are multiple variants, each is
separated by a colon &amp;quot;:&amp;quot;. A hyphen &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; between code points
indicates a character string. Any text appearing on a line to the right of a
number sign &amp;quot;#&amp;quot; is an explanatory comment about a code point or group
of code points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table conforms to current Swedish orthographic practice as described by
the Swedish Language Council in the publication &amp;quot;Svenska spr&amp;aring;kregler&amp;quot;,
2nd edition, 2000 (2003 printing), and the lexicographic practice documented
by the Swedish Academy in the publication &amp;quot;Svenska akademiens ordlista
&amp;ouml;ver svenska spr&amp;aring;ket&amp;quot;, 12th edition, seventh printing, 2002.
These sources recognize the use of a large number of foreign letters in Swedish
words. All such characters are not listed in the present table and their use
in Swedish language domains in .MUSEUM may be individually permitted if the
requesting entity can demonstrate warrant for doing so and the desired code
points are explicitly included as base characters in the character table for
another language in the .MUSEUM &amp;quot;European language group&amp;quot; as referenced
in the policy document cited above. Swedish belongs to the European language
group and the base characters listed below may be available for use as foreign
letters in other languages in that group if permitted in their respective character
tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character variants listed below are intended to call attention to situations
where confusion may arise if particular care is not taken to avoid it. No prescriptive
policies are attached to these character variants and the registration of a
domain containing one variant confers no rights to any other variant. All names
in .MUSEUM are subject to approval during an &amp;quot;Eligibility and Name Selection&amp;quot;
(ENS) process. Character variants are one of several factors considered to ensure
adequate differentiation between registered domains. The specific relevance
of variants will be determined for each domain during the ENS dialog within
a framework detailed in the policy statements for .MUSEUM, as described or referenced
in the policy document cited above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
