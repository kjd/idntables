            <t>This document describes a method of representing the domain name registration policy for a zone administrator
                using Extensible Markup Language (XML). These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs), are
                particularly used for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). The rulesets are used
                to implement and share policy defining which labels and specific Unicode code points are permitted for registrations,
                which alternative code points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on labels containing those
                variants.

        <section title="Introduction">

            <t>This memo describes a method of using Extensible Markup Language (XML) to describe the algorithm used to
                determine whether a given domain label is permitted, and under which conditions, based on the code points
                it contains and their context. These algorithms are comprised of a list of permissible code points,
                variant code point mappings, and a set of rules acting on them. These algorithms
                form part of a zone administrator's policies, and can be referred to as Label Generation Rulesets
                (LGRs), or IDN tables.
            </t>
            <t>Administrators of the zones for top-level domain registries have historically published their LGRs using
                ASCII text or HTML. The formatting of these documents has been loosely based on the format used for the
                Language Variant Table in <xref target="RFC3743"/>.
                <xref target="RFC4290"/>
                also provides a "model table format" that describes a similar set of functionality. Common to these formats
                is that the algorithms used to evaluate the data therein are implicit or specified elsewhere.
            </t>
            <t>Through the first decade of IDN deployment, experience has shown that LGRs derived from these formats are
                difficult to consistently implement and compare due to their differing formats. A universal format, such
                as one using a structured XML format, will assist by improving machine-readability, consistency,
                reusability and maintainability of LGRs. It also provides for more complex conditional implementation of
                variants that reflects the known requirements of current zone administrator policies.
            </t>
            <t>Another feature of this format is that it allows many of the algorithms to be made explicit and machine
                implementable. A remaining small set of implicit algorithms is described in this document to allow commonality
                 in implementation.
            </t>
            <t>While the predominant usage of this specification is to represent IDN label policy, the format is not
                limited to IDN usage may also be used for describing ASCII domain name label rulesets.
            </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Design Goals">

            <t>The following items are explicit design goals of this format:</t>

            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>MUST be in a format that can be implemented in a reasonably straightforward manner in software;
                    </t>

                    <t>The format SHOULD be able to be checked for formatting errors, such that common mistakes can be
                        caught;
                    </t>

                    <t>An LGR MUST be able to express the set of valid code points that are allowed for registration
                        under a specific zone administrator's policies;
                    </t>

                    <t>MUST be able to express computed alternatives to a given domain name based on mapping relationships 
                        between code points, whether one-to-one or many-to-many. These computed alternatives are commonly
                        known as "variants";
                    </t>

                    <t>Variant code points SHOULD be able to be tagged with specific dispositions or categories that can be
                        used to support registry policy (such as whether to allocate the computed variant in the zone, or to
                        merely block it from registration);
                    </t>

                    <t>Variants and code points MUST be able to stipulated based on contextual information. For example, specific
                        variants may only be applicable when they follow another specific code point, or when the code
                        point is displayed in a specific presentation form;
                    </t>

                    <t>The data contained within an LGR MUST be able to be interpreted unambiguously, such that independent 
                        implementations that utilize the contents will arrive at the same results;
                    </t>

                    <t>To the largest extent possible, policy rules SHOULD be able to be specified in the XML format without relying
                        hidden, or built-in algorithms in implementations.</t>

                    <t>LGRs SHOULD be suitable for comparison and re-use, such that one could easily compare the
                        contents of two or more to see the differences, to merge them, and so on.
                    </t>

                    <t>LGRs SHOULD be able to be merged automatically, at the minimum where code points and variant information is
                        concerned.
                    </t>

                    <t>As many existing IDN tables as practicable SHOULD be able to be migrated to the LGR format with
                        all applicable logic retained.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>It is explicitly NOT the goal of this format to stipulate what code points should be listed in an LGR by
                a zone administrator. Which registration policies are used for a particular zone is outside the scope of
                this memo.
            </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Requirements">
            <t>To be able to fulfill the known utilization of LGRs,
                the existing corpus of published IDN tables were reviewed to prepare this specification.
            </t>
            <t>In addition, the requirements of ICANN's work to implement an LGR for the DNS Root Zone
                <xref target="LGR-PROCEDURE"/>
                were also considered. In particular, Section B of that document identifies five specific requirements for an LGR methodology.
            </t>
            <t>Finally, the syntax and rules in
                <xref target="RFC5892"/> and <xref target="RFC3743" />
                were reviewed.
            </t>

            <t>Altogether these reviews resulted in the following requirements:</t>
            <t>
                 <list style="symbols">
                    <t>The ability to identify a set of code points that are permitted.</t>
                    <t>The ability to include code points that are permitted only in given contexts.</t>
                    <t>The ability to represent a list of variants, if any, for each code point.</t>
                    <t>The ability to include variants that are defined only in given contexts.</t>
                    <t>The ability to assign a single disposition or categorization for each variants</t>
                    <t>The ability to assign variants with reflexive mappings.</t>
                    <t>The ability to assign variants that have a code point sequence as target.</t>
                    <t>The ability to express variant mappings symmetrically.</t>
                    <t>A method of identifying code points that are related, using a one or several tags per code point.</t>
                    <t>The ability to describe rules regarding the possible actions that may be performed on the
                        resulting label (such as block, allocatable, etc.)
                    </t>
                    <t>The ability to describe rules that check for ill-formed combinations across the whole label.</t>
                    <t>The ability to describe rules that define contexts in which code points are permissible or variants defined.</t>
                    <t>The ability to preserve normative reference information as well as informative comments.</t>

                <t>The basic XML framework of the document is as follows:</t>

                </figure>

                <t>Within the "lgr" element rest several sub-elements. First is a "meta" element that contains all
                    meta-data associated with the IDN table, such as its authorship, what it is used for, implementation
                    notes and references. This is followed by a "data" element that contains the substantive code point
                    data. Finally, an optional "rules" element contains information on contextual and whole-label evaluation
                    rules, if any, along with any specific action elements providing for the disposition of labels and computed
                    variant labels.

                <t>A document MUST contain exactly one "lgr" element. Each "lgr" element MUST contain exactly one "data"
                    element, optionally preceded by one "meta" element and optionally followed by one "rules" element.

            </section>
            <section title="Metadata">

                <t>The "meta" element is used to express meta-data associated within the LGR. It can be used to identify
                    the author or relevant contact person, explain the intended usage of the LGR, and provide
                    implementation notes as well as references. The data contained within is not required by software
                    consuming the LGR in order to calculate valid labels, or to calculate variants. However, the
                    "unicode-version" element MUST be used by a consumer of the table  to identify that it has the right
                    Unicode data to perform operations on the table.

                <section title="The version Element">

                    <t>The "version" element is used to uniquely identify each version of the LGR being represented. No
                        specific format is required, but it is RECOMMENDED that it be a numerical positive integer,
                        which is incremented with each revision of the file.

                    <t>The "language" element signals that the LGR is associated with a specific language or script. The
                        value of the language element must be a valid language tag as described in <xref
                                target="RFC5646"/>. The tag may simply refer to a script if the LGR is not referring to
                        a specific language.
                    </t>

                    <t>Example of an English language LGR:</t>

                    <t>If the LGR applies to a specific script, rather than a language, the "und" language tag should be
                        used followed by the relevant
                        <xref target="RFC5646"/>
                        script subtag. For example, for a Cyrillic script LGR:

                    <t>If the LGR covers a specific set of multiple languages or scripts, the language element can be
                        repeated. However, for cases of a script-specific LGR exhibiting insignificant admixture of code points
                        from other scripts, it is RECOMMENDED to the use a single "language" element identifying the
                        predominant script. In the exceptional case of a multi-script LGR where no script is predominant,
                        use Zyyy (Common):

                        mixture of scripts used in writing that language. The preferred language element would be:

        <section title="Code Points and Variants">

            <t>The bulk of a label generation ruleset is a description of which set of code points are eligible for a
                given label. For rulesets that perform operations that result in potential variants, the code
                point-level relationships between variants need to also be described.
            </t>

            <t>The code point data is collected within a "data" element. Within this element, a series of "char" and
                "range" elements describe eligible code points, or ranges of code points, respectively.
            </t>

            <t>Discrete permissible code points or code point sequences are declared with a "char" element, e.g.</t>

            <t><figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[    <char cp="002D"/>]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>

            <t>Ranges of permissible code points may be stipulated with a "range" element, e.g.</t>

            <t><figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[    <range first-cp="0030" last-cp="0039"/>]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>

            <t>The range is inclusive of the first and last code points. Whether code points are specified individually
                or as part of a range makes no difference in processing the data, and tools reading or writing the
                XML format are not required to retain a distinction. All attributes defined for a range element are as if applied
                to each code point within.
            </t>

            <t>Code points must be expressed in uppercase, hexadecimal, and zero padded to a minimum of 4 digits - in
                other words according to the standard Unicode convention but without the prefix "U+". The rationale for
                not allowing other encoding formats, including native Unicode encoding in XML, is explored in <xref
                        target="UAX42"/>. The XML conventions used in this format, including the element and attribute
                names, mirror this document where practical and reasonable to do so. It is RECOMMENDED to list
                all "char" elements  in ascending order of cp attribute.

            <section title="Sequences" anchor="sequences">

                <t>A sequence of two or more code points may be specified in a LGR, for example, when defining the

                    of code points is required to occur in order for the constituent elements to be eligible, such as
                    when a specific code point is only eligible when preceded or followed by another code point. The
                    following would define the eligibility of the MIDDLE DOT (U+00B7) only when both preceded and
                    followed by the LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C):

                <t>As an alternative to using sequences to define a required context, a "char" or "range" element may
                    specify conditional context in a "when" attribute as described below in <xref target="when"/>. The
                    latter method is more flexible in that such conditional context is not limited to specific code
                    point in addition to allowing both prohibited as well as required context to be specified.

            <section title="Variants">

                <t>While most LGRs typically only determine code point eligibility, others additionally specify a
                    mapping of code points to other code points, known as "variants". What constitutes a variant code point is a
                    matter of policy, and varies for each implementation. The following examples are intended to
                    demonstrate the syntax; they are not necessarily typical.

                <section title="Basic Variants">

                    <t>For example, to map LATIN SMALL LETTER V (U+0076) as a variant of LATIN SMALL LETTER U
                        (U+0075):

                    </figure></t>
                    <t>A sequence of multiple code points can be specified as a variant of a single code point. For
                        example, the sequence of LATIN SMALL LETTER O (U+006F) then LATIN SMALL LETTER E (U+0065) might
                        hypothetically be specified as a variant for an LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS (U+00F6) as
                        follows:
                    </t>

    </char>]]></artwork>
                    </figure></t>

                    <t>The "var" element specifies variant mappings in only one direction, even though the variant relation is
                        usually considered symmetric, that is, if A is a variant of B then B should also be a variant
                        of A. The format requires that the inverse of the variant be given explicitly to fully specify
                        symmetric variant relations in the IDN table. This has the beneficial side effect of making the
                        symmetry explicit:
                    </t>

    </char>]]></artwork>
                    </figure></t>

                    <t>Both the source and target of a variant mapping may be sequences. As it is not possible to
                        specify variants for ranges, ranges cannot be used for characters for which variant relations
                        need to be defined.
                    </t>
                    <t>All variants MUST be unique. For a given "char" element all variants must have a unique
                     combination of "cp" , "when" and "not-when" attributes. It is RECOMMENDED to list the
                     "var" elements  in ascending order of their target code point sequence.</t>

                <section title="Null Variants">

                    <t>To specify a null variant, which is a variant string that maps to no code point, use an empty cp
                        attribute. For example, to mark a string with a ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (U+200C) to the same
                        string without the ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER:

                    <t>This is useful in expressing the intent that some code points in a label are to be mapped away when 
                    generating a canonical variant of the label.  However, in tables that are designed to have symmetric
                    variant mappings, this could lead to combinatorial explosion, if not handled carefully.</t>

                    <t>The symmetric form of a null variant is expressed as follows:</t>

                    <t>A char element with an empty "cp" attribute MUST specify at least one variant mapping, or the results
                    are undefined. It is strongly RECOMMENDED to use a disposition of  'invalid" or equivalent when defining variant
                    mappings from null sequences, so that variant mapping from null sequences are removed in variant label generation.</t>

                Adding a "var" element  allows both a disposition and a reference id

                variant of itself (reflexive mapping). Assuming an original label of "3473 3447", the permuted variant "3473 3473"
                would consist of the reflexive variant of 3473 followed by a variant of 3447. Accordingly, the
                dispositions for both of the variant mappings used to generate that particular permutation would
                have the value "preferred" given the following definitions of variant mappings:</t>

                    <t>Having established the disposition values in this way, a set of actions could be defined that return 
                    a disposition of "allocate" or "activate" for a label consisting exclusively of variants with disposition
                    "preferred" for example. (For details on how to define actions based

                    In general, using reflexive variant mappings in this manner, makes it possible to calculate disposition
                    values using a uniform approach for all labels, whether they consist of mapped variant code point,
                    original code points, or a mixture of both. In particular, the disposition values for two otherwise identical labels
                    may differ based on which variant mappings were executed in order to generate each of them.

                    <t>Fundamentally, variants are mappings between two sequences of code points. However, in some
                        instances for a variant relationship to exist, some context external to the code point sequence
                        must be considered. For example, a positional context may determine whether two
                        code point sequences are variants of each other. </t>

                        <t>An example of that are the Arabic code points, which can
                        have different forms based on position, with some code points sharing forms, thus making them
                        variants in the positions corresponding to those forms. Such positional context cannot be solely
                        derived from the code point by itself, as the code point would be the same for the various forms.
                    </t>

                    <t>To specify a conditional variant relationship the optional "when" attribute is used. The variant
                        relationship exists when the condition in the "when" attribute is satisfied. A "not-when"
                        attribute may be used for conditions that must not be satisfied. The value of each "when" or
                        "not-when" attributes is a parameterized context rule as described below in <xref
                                target="parameterized_context_rule"/>.

                        (U+0673) as a variant of ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH HAMZA BELOW (U+0625), but only when it appears

                        requiring explicit definitions for these rules, this mechanism can easily handle any additional

                <t>Typically, LGRs are used to explicitly designate allowable code points, where any label that contains a code
                    point not explicitly listed in the LGR is considered an ineligible label according to the
                    ruleset.
                </t>
                <t>For more complex registry rules, there may be a need to discern on or more subsets code points. This
                    can be accomplished by applying a "tag" attribute to char or range elements, thereby defining character 
                    classes (see <xref target="tag_based_classes" />) which can then be used in whole label evaluation
                    rules (see <xref target="match_operators" />). Tag attributes may be of any value, and multiple values are
                    separated by space. Code point sequences not being proper members of a set of code points, a "tag"  attribute
                    MUST NOT be present in a char element defining a code point sequence.
                </t>
                <t>A simple example of tag use would be to label preferred code points (as in <xref target="RFC3743"/>) 
                   by adding "preferred" to the tag, and then using a rule such as shown in  <xref target="rule"/> to single
                   out labels for allocation that consist entirely of such preferred code points. For a variety of reasons, actual
                   tables use a different approach.

                <t>The code points in a label sometimes need to satisfy context-based rules, for example for the label
                    to be considered valid, or to satisfy the context for a variant mapping (see the description of the
                    "when" attribute in <xref target="parameterized_context_rule"/>).
                </t>
                <t>A Whole Label Evaluation rule (WLE) is applied to the whole label. It is used to validate both
                    original labels and variant labels computed from them using a permutation over all applicable
                    variant mappings. A conditional context rules is a specialized
                    form of WLE specific to the context around a single code point or code point sequence. For example,
                    if a rule is referenced in the "when" attribute of a variant mapping it is used to describe the
                    conditional context under which the particular variant mapping is defined to exist.

            <section title="The action Element" anchor="actions">

                <t>The purpose of a rule is to trigger a specific action. Often, the action simply results in blocking or invalidating a
                    label that does not match a rule. An example of an action invalidating a label because it does not match a rule 
                    named "leading-letter" is as follows:
                </t>

                    </figure>
                </t>

                <t>If an action is to be triggered on matching a rule, a "match" attribute is used instead.   Actions are 
                evaluated in the order that they appear in the XML file, Once an action
                     is triggered by a label, the disposition defined in the "disp" attribute is assigned
                     to the label and no other actions are evaluated for that label. </t>

              <section title="The match and not-match Attributes" anchor="match_attribute">
                <t>A "match" or "not-match" attribute specify a rule that must be matched or not matched
                as a condition for triggering an action. Only a single rule
                     may be named as the value of a "match" or "not-match" attribute. Because rules may be composed
                     of other rules, this restriction to a single attribute value does not impose any limitation on the contexts that can
                     trigger an action.</t>

               <t>An action may contain a "match" or a "not-match" attribute, but not both. An action without any
                attributes is triggered by all labels unconditionally.  For a very simple LGR, the following action would
                allocate all labels that match the repertoire:</t>

                <t>Since rules are evaluated for all labels, whether they are the original label or computed by permuting
                the defined and valid variant mappings for the label's code points, actions based
                on matching or not matching a rule may be triggered for both original and variant labels, but they
                the rules are not affected by the disposition attributes of the variant mappings. To trigger any actions base on
                these dispositions requires the use additional optional attributes for actions described next.

                <t>An action may contain one of the optional attributes "any-variant", "all-variants" or "only-variants" defining triggers
                    based on variant dispositions. The permitted value
                    for these attributes consists of one or more variant disposition values, separated by space.  When a variant label
                    is generated, these disposition values are compared to the disposition values on the variant mappings
                    used to generate the particular variant label. </t>

                    <t>Any single match may trigger an action that contains an "any-variant" attribute, while for an "all-variants",
                    "only-variants" attribute, the dispositions for all variant code points must match one or several of the
                    dispositions specified in the attribute value to trigger the action. An "only-variants" attribute will trigger
                    the action only if the variant label    contains no original code points other than those with a reflexive mapping (see 
                    <xref target="reflexive_mapping" />).</t>

                    <t>One of these variant disposition triggers may be used by itself or in conjunction with an attribute matching or
                    not-matching a rule. If variant triggers and rule-matching triggers are used together, the label MUST "match" or respectively
                     "not-match" the specified rule, AND satisfy the conditions on the disposition values given by the "any-variant",
                     "all-variants", or "only-variants" attribute.

                <t>This section gives an example of using variant disposition triggers, combined with variants with reflexive
                 mappings <xref target="reflexive_mapping"/> to achieve LGRs that implement tables like those defined
                 according to <xref target="RFC3743"/> where the l is to allow only variants that consist entirely of simplified or
                 traditional variants, in addition to the original label. </t>
                 <t>Assuming an LGR where all variants have been given suitable "disp" attributes
                 of "block", "simplified", "traditional", or "both", similar to the one in <xref target="translate_rfc3743" />.
                    Given such an LGR, the following example actions evaluate the disposition for the variant label:

    <action disp="allocate" />]]></artwork>
                    </figure>
                </t>
                <t>The first action matches any variant label for which at least one of the code point variants carries
                    the disposition "block". The second matches any variant label for which all of the code point
                    variants carry the disposition "simplified" or "both", in other words an all-simplified label. The third matches any
                     label for which all
                    variants carry the disposition "traditional" or "both", or all traditional. These two actions are not triggered by any
                    variant labels containing some original code points, unless the code point has a variant defined with
                    a reflexive mapping (<xref target="reflexive_mapping" />). </t>

                    <t>The final two actions rely on the fact that actions are evaluated in sequence, and that the first
                    action triggered also defines the final disposition for a variant label (see <xref target="precedence"/>).
                    They further rely on the assumption that the only variants with disposition "both" are also identity 
                    variants.</t>
                    <t>
                     Given these assumptions, any remaining simplified or traditional
                    variants must then be part of a mixed label, and so are blocked; all labels surviving to the last action are
                    original code points only (that is the original label). </t>

                    <t>The assumption on identity mapping made above does not necessarily hold, so this scheme needs
                     some refinements to cover tables where it is violated. For a more complete example,

                <t>In order to use a table to test a specific domain label for membership in the LGR, a consumer of the
                    LGR must iterate through each code point within a given U-label, and test that each code point is a
                    member of the LGR. If any code point is not a member of the LGR, it shall be deemed as not eligible
                    in accordance with the table.
                </t>

                <t>A code point is deemed a member of the table when it is listed with the "char" element, and all
                    necessary condition listed in "when" or "not-when" attributes are correctly satisfied.
                </t>

                <t>A label must also not trigger any action that results in a disposition of "invalid" or equivalent, otherwise
                it is deemed not eligible. (This step may be deferred, until dispositions are determined)</t>

                <t>For LGRs that contain reflexive variant mappings (defined in <xref target="reflexive_mapping" />) the evaluation
                of dispositions must be deferred until variants are generated. In essence, tables that use this feature treat the original
                as the (identity) variant of itself. For such tables, the ordinary iteration over code points can at best be used to exclude
                a subset of invalid labels, effectively a pre-screening.</t>

    <t>
    Here the simplified variants have been given a disposition of "simp",
    the traditional variants one of "trad" and all other ones are given "block".
    </t>
    <t>
    Note that some variant mappings map to themselves (identity), that is
    the mapping is reflexive (see <xref target="reflexive_mapping" />).
    In creating the permutation of all variant labels, these mappings have
    no effect, other than adding a value to the variant disposition list
    for the variant label containing them.
    </t>
    <t>
    Because some variant mappings show in more than one column, while
    the XML format allows only a single disposition value, they have
    been given the disposition of "both".
    </t>
    <t>In the example so far, all of these are  also mappings where source
    and target are identical that is, reflexive mappings as defined in <xref target="reflexive_mapping" />.
    </t>
     <t>
     Given a label "U+4E7E U+4E81", the following labels would be ruled
     allocatable under <xref target="RFC3743" /> based on how it is commonly
     implemented in domain registries:</t>
<t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[    Original label:     U+4E7E U+4E81
    Simplified label 1: U+4E7E U+5E72
    Simplified label 2: U+5E72 U+5E72
    Traditional label:  U+4E7E U+4E7E]]></artwork></figure></t>
<t>
    However, If we generated allocatable labels without regard to the 
    simplified-to-traditional variants, we would end up with an extra allocatable
    label: "U+5E72 U+4E7E". That label is comprised of an SC character and a TC
    character which shouldn't be allocatable, but it would be the result of a straight
    permutation of all variants with disposition other than disp="block".
</t>
<t>
    To more fully resolve the dispositions requires several actions to be defined as 
    described in <xref target="rfc3743_example" />. After blocking all labels that
    contain a variant with disposition "block", these actions will first allocate all labels that
    consist entirely of variants (including variants with reflexive mappings) that are "simp" or "both", then do
    likewise for labels that are entirely "trad" or "both". All surviving labels containing
    any one of the dispositions "simp" or "trad" are now known to be part of an undesirable mixed
    simplified/traditional label and are blocked. Finally, the remaining labels must be code points without
    variants or reflexive variants of type "both", in other words, the original label.
</t>
<t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[  <rules>
    <!--Action elements - order defines precedence-->
    <action disp="block" any-variant="block"
        comment="filter out by blocked code point" />
    <action disp="allocate"
        only-variants="simp both"
        comment="only allocate if simplified variant
        including reflexive (identity) mapping" />
    <action disp="allocate"
        only-variants="trad both"
        comment="only allocate if traditional variant,
        including reflexive (identity) mapping" />
    <action disp="block"
        any-variant="simp trad"
        comment="filter out any remaining variant code point" />
    <action disp="activate" comment="surviving labels must be
        original labels" />
  </rules>]]></artwork></figure></t>
  
 <t>In the example above, variants with the disposition "both" occur only as part of identity 
 mappings (as pointed out in the comments). The scheme described so far relies on the assumption
 that this is always the case. However, consider the following set of variants:
 </t>
 <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[    U+62E0;U+636E;U+636E;U+64DA
    U+636E;U+636E;U+64DA;U+62E0
    U+64DA;U+636E;U+64DA;U+62E0]]></artwork></figure></t>
    <t>for which the corresponding XML would be:</t>
 <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[    <char cp="62E0">
    <var cp="636E" disp="both" comment=" BOTH, but NOT identity" />
    <var cp="64DA" disp="block" />
    </char>
    <char cp="636E">
    <var cp="636E" disp="simp" comment="identity, but not BOTH" />
    <var cp="64DA" disp="trad" />
    <var cp="62E0" disp="block" />
    </char>
    <char cp="64DA">
    <var cp="636E" disp="simp" />
    <var cp="64DA" disp="trad" comment="identity" />
    <var cp="62E0" disp="block" />
    </char>]]></artwork></figure></t>
    <t>
    What is needed to make such variant sets work is a way to capture when a
    disposition is associated with an identity or reflexive mapping, and when it is associated with an
    ordinary variant mapping. This can be done by adding a prefix "i-" in front of the disposition
    whenever the mapping is an identity mapping, for example the last "trad" in the
    preceding figure would become "i-trad".</t>
    <t>
    With all the dispositions prepared in this way, only a slight modification to the actions
    is needed to yield the correct set of allocatable labels:
    </t>
 <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[    <action disp="block" any-variant="block" />
    <action disp="allocate" only-variants="simp i-simp both i-both" />
    <action disp="allocate" only-variants="trad i-trad both i-both" />
    <action disp="block" all-variants="simp trad both" />
    <action disp="allocate" />
]]></artwork></figure></t>
          <t>The first three actions get triggered by the same labels as before.</t>
          <t>
          The fourth action blocks any label that combines an original code point
          with any of the variant mappings, yet lets through all labels that are a
          combination of only  original code points (everything having either no variant
          mapping or one of the identity mappings). These are the original labels
          and they are allocated in the last action.</t>

          <t>With this modification all RFC 3743-style tables can be converted
          to XML and, by using the above set of actions, the result will be that
          all variants consisting completely of variants preferred for simplified
          or traditional, respectively, will be allocated, as will be the original label.
          All other variant labels will be blocked.</t>
       </section>

        <section title="Indic Syllable Structure Example" anchor="indic_syllable" >

        <t>
        In LGRs for Indic scripts it may be desirable to restrict valid labels to sequences
        of valid Indic syllables, or aksharas. This appendix gives a sample set of rules
        designed to enforce this restriction.
        </t>
        <t>We start with the following BNF form for an akshara which has been
        published in “Devanagari Script Behavior for Hindi" <xref  target="TDIL-HINDI" /> but which,
        if not directly valid for other languages and scripts used in India is at least similar
        to equivalent definitions used for them.</t>

        <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[    V[m]|{C[N]H}C[N](H|[v][m])]]></artwork></figure></t>
        
        <t>Where:</t>
		<t>
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">
            <t hangText="V">(upper case) is any independent vowel</t>
            <t hangText="m"> is any vowel modifier (Devanagari Anusvara, Visarga, and Candrabindu)</t>
            <t hangText="C"> is any consonant (with inherent vowel)</t>
            <t hangText="N"> is Nukta</t>
            <t hangText="H"> is a Halant (or Virama)</t>
            <t hangText="v"> (lower case) is any dependent vowel sign (matra)</t>
            <t hangText="{}"> encloses items which may be repeated one or more times</t>
            <t hangText="[ ]"> encloses items which may or may not be present</t>
            <t hangText="|"> separates items, out of which only one can be present</t>
        </list>
	</t>
     <t>
     By using the Unicode property "InSC" or "Indic_Syllable_Category" which corresponds
     rather directly to the classification of characters in the BNF above, we can directly
     translate the BNF into a set of WLE rules matching the definition of an akshara.</t>

    <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[ <rules>

        <rule byref="optional-dependent-vowel-with-optional-modifier" />
      </choice>
    </rule>
    <rule name="akshara">
      <choice>
        <rule byref="independent-vowel-with-optional-modifier" />
        <rule byref="consonant-cluster" />
      </choice>
    </rule>
    <rule name="WLE-akshara-or-other" comment="series of one or
        more aksharas, possibly alternating with other types of
        code points such as digits">

      <choice count="1+">
        <class property="InSC:other"  />
        <rule byref="akshara"  />

      <end />
    </rule>
    <!--Action elements go here - order defines precedence-->
    <action disp="invalid" not-match="WLE-akshara-or-other" />
  </rules>]]></artwork></figure></t>
    
    <t>
    With the rules and classes as defined above, the final action assigns a disposition of "invalid" to
    all labels that are not composed of a sequence of well-formed aksharas, optionally interspersed
    with other characters, perhaps digits, for example.</t>

    <t>
    The relevant Unicode property is as of this writing still considered provisional;
    however, it could be replicated by tagging repertoire values directly in the LGR
    which would remove the dependency on the Unicode Standard altogether.

            <t>This format builds upon the work on documenting IDN tables by many different registry operators. Notably,
                a comprehensive language table for Chinese, Japanese and Korean was developed by the "Joint Engineering
                Team"
                <xref target="RFC3743"/>
                that is the basis of many registry policies; and a set of guidelines for Arabic script registrations
                <xref target="RFC5564"/>
                was published by the Arabic-language community.
