This library provides the ability to generate, manipulate and check
against "Label Generation Rulesets", which are formal descriptions
of which code points are available for registration by domain name
registries.  These tables can also specify contextual rules, as
well as rules for generating sets of labels derived from nominated
code point variants.

The Python library is designed to be an implementation of a prospective
XML-based table format described in the specification/ subdirectory.

This toolkit was originally named "idntables", however was renamed to
reflect the evolution of terminology from "IDN Tables" and "Variant
Tables" to "Label Generation Rulesets".
