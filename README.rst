idntables
---------

This library provides the ability to generate, manipulate and check
against "IDN Tables", which are formal descriptions of which code
points are available for registration by internationalised domain
name registries.  These tables can also specify contextual rules, as
well as rules for generating sets of labels derived from nominated
code point variants.

The Python library is designed to be an implementation of a prospective
XML-based table format described in the specification/ subdirectory.
